This project is an UI port of [Getaviz](https://github.com/softvis-research/Getaviz) for *Mixed Reality* on a 
**Microsoft HoloLens**. It only supports the "city metaphor".

## Import A-Frame Model

If you want to import a different model, created by the [Getaviz](https://github.com/softvis-research/Getaviz) generator, 
put the `model.html` and the `metaData.json` into the `Assets/_generator-data` folder.
